I am super excited to be presenting *MongoDB large-scale data centric architectures* at QCon, Friday Nov 9th in the <a href=http://qconsf.com/sf2012/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=685>NoSQL Emergence track</a>. My talk will focus on the realities of running the MongoDB database at scale, what challenges it presents, where it works great, and where it doesn&#8217;t. This is stuff anyone who wants to run MongoDB at any serious level should plan to attend. Stop by and say hello, it should be a hoot. I promise no web-scale references!

If you register with my code: **gorm100**, you will get $100 off at registration time and another $100 will get donated to the <a href=http://www.sffoodbank.org/>San Francisco Food Bank</a>. Let&#8217;s do this people, you get to come hear <del datetime="2012-10-03T04:10:33+00:00">from</del> some excellent talks at the conference, and some other folks get to eat.
