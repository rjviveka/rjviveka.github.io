The folks over at [NoSQLDatabases.com][1] have posted an interview they did with me on our implementation of MongoDB at Shutterfly. Good folks, great blog. [Here is a link][2] to the article. I talk a lot about what we have done at Shutterfly, In particular one item I discuss is [ORM&#8217;s][3] and the promise of not using heavyweight mappers in a non-relational architecture. I also talk a bit about the challenges and benefits of modeling data as documents. I hope it&#8217;s helpful for folks thinking about using something like MongoDB.
