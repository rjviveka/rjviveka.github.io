I moved the pgstat (previously named pgd) project to [pgfoundry][1]. Thank you to the folks over there approving the project. I added a column for &#8216;active&#8217; processes from pg\_stat\_activity as well as some fixes requested by Devrim that I really should have had done from the start. Thanks for the contribution. Downloads can be [found here][2]. Oh, and I will remove the OSX file from the .tar file in the future.

Want something added? Just comment on this post..
