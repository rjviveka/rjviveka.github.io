Shutterfly is a well known internet property with a massivly growing customer base and thus new and interesting challenges in how to store, share, and organize data. What fantastic fun. I expect to post more on the growing [NOSQL movement ][3]as well as continuing information on [PostgreSQL][4] and more traditional relational stores like [Oracle][5].
