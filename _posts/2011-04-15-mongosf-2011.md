I am very excited to speak @ [MongoSF 2011][1]. We have been doing quite a bit of performance tuning lately at Shutterfly as we deploy more and more MongoDB services. My hope is I can share some of what we have been doing in terms of performance tuning and performance management and it will be valuable to folks who may face performance challenges with MongoDB. I just wanted to put up some of the specific items I will be going over:

*   Utilizing the profiler, interpreting the data, and using it to make your application faster.  For instance, do you know how to see when your document updates cause a document to be read and re-written inside the datafile?
*   How to tune around the the single db-wide lock in MongoDB.  How to minimize it&#8217;s impact.
*   How to monitor using mongostat.  What to look for, and what to do when you find something bad.  For instance, are you looking at &#8216;locked %&#8217;?  You should be!
