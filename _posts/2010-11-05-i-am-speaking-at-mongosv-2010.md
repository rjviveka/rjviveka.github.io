I am excited to announce I will be speaking at the [MongoSV conference][1] Dec 3 2010. My talk, *Sharing Life&#8217;s Joy using MongoDB: A Shutterfly Case Study* will be focused on how we have been using MongoDB here at Shutterfly over the last year. I plan to outline some of the specific cases where MongoDB has been a massive win and some areas to be careful of if you are planning your own MongoDB application. This is a follow on to my [previous talk][2] at MongoSF with more technical depth. I will show code examples and various use cases outlining parts of our journey.

I hope to see you all there, it&#8217;s shaping up to look like an amazing lineup. I think this conference will be great for anyone new to non-relational data stores as well as people who already are neck deep in a MongoDB implementation. So [Sign up NOW][3]!
