I decided to start futzing with Python and Oracle. I generally use perl for most everything, and sometimes php for web based things, but I wanted to try Python at the urging of colleagues. I downloaded the source fromÂ <a href="http://www.python.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>,Â and added in cx_Oracle fromÂ <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-oracle/" target="_blank">here</a>Â . The installation on linux was about as smooth as possible. I installed the source @ ~oracle/python so I could keep a user space version of Python. This is similar to how I generally install perl. So I created my first application using Python, &#8220;select * from dual&#8221;. No big deal, but wow, Python is a pretty straightforward language. Here are some resources for Oracle based code:  
<a href="http://www.ioug.org/python.pdf" target="_blank">IOUG PaperÂ </a>  
<a href="http://www.python.net/crew/atuining/cx_Oracle/html/cx_Oracle.html" target="_blank">The Docs</a>  
The docs and code examples are pretty slim for Oracle, but I supposed that to be expected as the language and it&#8217;s use with Oracle expands over time. Here is an example of the hello world app:Â 

<pre lang="python">#!/home/kgorman/python/bin/python
import cx_Oracle
handle=cx_Oracle.connect('scott/tiger@test')
curs=handle.cursor()
sql="""    select * from dual       """
curs.execute(sql)
row = curs.fetchone()
print row[0]
curs.close()</pre>
