I had a great time presenting at MongoSV <a href=http://www.kennygorman.com/wordpress/?p=776>last year</a>.  This year I am presenting a talk on MongoDB performance tuning, similar to what I <a href=http://www.kennygorman.com/wordpress/?p=818>presented at MongoSF</a> but with some updated items around scalability, tuning, and hardware!  My college Luciano Resende is also speaking.  I hope to give some insight into some of the work we have done at Shutterfly around performance tuning and scalability.  I also hope to speak in more detail about our implementation of the <a href=https://github.com/facebook/flashcache/>Facebook Flashcache</a> technology.  If you haven&#8217;t signed up, you can <a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/mongosv-2011" target="1">register here</a> for the conference. Here is a video 10gen put out for the conference:
