The folks at <a href="http://320press.com/" target="_blank">320press</a> released their <a href="http://320press.com/themes/wp-bootstrap/" target="_blank">wp-bootstrap</a> v2.0 theme a while back.

WP-bootstrap is based on the <a href="http://themble.com/bones/" target="_blank">bones</a> framework and implements my personal favorite <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">boostrap</a> framework into <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.

Thats a pretty hefty stack of technologies. That said, it&#8217;s impact is substantial. I have been using WordPress for this blog since <a href="http://www.kennygorman.com/wordpress/?m=200605" target="_blank">May of 2006</a> and finally have a super rich and simplistic theming toolset. Previously each theme had it&#8217;s own design and layout. In recent time (what like the last couple years), bootstrap has come onto the scene. The bootstrap framework is very powerful, and wp-bootstrap plugs it right into WordPress via the theme framework. Heck yeah.

Simple customization of themes is now very simple. All of the native bootstrap elements are valid, and of course and be customized and extended. The theme is fully <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets" target="_blank">widgetized</a> as well. In addition 320press has taken great care to make the theme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">responsive</a>. Thus this is the first time my blog looks reasonable on a variety of devices. It has <a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/features/shortcode-reference/" target="_blank">shortcodes</a> and the theme allows for customization inside the WordPress theme settings panel. One of the niceties I have already taken advantage is a simple CSS text area where you can drop in whatever CSS changes you want. Simple.

So, I suspect over the coming weeks and months I will be noodling with my theming and layouts quite a bit. It&#8217;s just too fun and easy now! Great job 320press!
