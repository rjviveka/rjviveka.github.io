As I was shutting down my last Sun server in my colo, I was thinking back about how things have changed. It's sad to see such a great company [fall](http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/the-rise-and-fall-sun-microsystems-914&#038;current=1&#038;last=1#slideshowTop). But it seems there is [little](http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/license-change-leaves-sun-solaris-users-crossroads-858) reason to keep using Sun or Solaris. We will miss you Sun.
