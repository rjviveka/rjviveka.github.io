I just uploaded a little utility that pulls performance data from [MongoDB][1] and loads it into [rrdtool][2] for trending and analysis.

Sure there are options like [cacti][3] out there, but this is just a simple raw utility vs something designed for a larger environment. Simple.

Feedback would be awesome.
