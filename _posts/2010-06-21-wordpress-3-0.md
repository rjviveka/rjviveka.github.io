On June 17th, WordPress 3.0 [was launched][1]. I decided to take the plunge and upgrade. There are just so many compelling features it&#8217;s hard not to. Part of the new release is the twenty ten theme with some pretty exciting features including a new menu system that I hope to take advantage of as well as featured images. I decided to go ahead and use it, and thus the new look.

I try not to blog about blogging, but I couldn&#8217;t help it in this case. The upgrade is pretty compelling, and I thought I would share my thoughts.
