I have been playing quite a bit with [MongoDB][1] lately. MongoDB is a [nosql][2] type database. It&#8217;s different than a simple k/v store however. It allows sorting, secondary indexes and such. It&#8217;s format is [BSON][3] a binary representation of [JSON][4] with some additions.

Anyway.. Wow what a mind bender working in the &#8216;schema-less&#8217; nosql type databases is.

One of the things I needed in order to evaluate performance is a tool similar to [pgstat2][5] and/or iostat for mongodb performance. So yet again, I created a tool, and [posted it up on github][6]. It&#8217;s still just beta and quite simple. Feel free to give feedback on github.
