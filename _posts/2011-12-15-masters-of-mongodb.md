The day before this years [MongoSV Conference][1] a few folks, chosen by 10gen, and labelled the [Masters of MongoDB][2] gathered to discuss the MongoDB platform, swap war stories, share gripes, and overall give feedback on the direction and roadmap of MongoDB to the 10gen folks.

First of all, I am incredibly honored to be considered in such a group of high caliber folks. But beyond that I was struck by the level of commitment that 10gen has to making sure the roadmap is proper and that they are listening very closely to the community. I feel like with such a commitment the areas for improvement in MongoDB will get good attention and focus. I think this is a huge component for consideration when looking at MongoDB. The community is very very strong. Â I made lots of good contacts and was able to connect with friends.

Thanks 10gen for putting on such a good event, and above all, listening to your customers.
