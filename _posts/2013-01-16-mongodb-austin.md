I am very excited to present at the [MongoDBAustin][1] conference on February 15th 2013 in Austin TX!

I am giving a completely new presentation; &#8220;MongoDB Performance; Profiler Deep Dive&#8221;. The purpose of this discussion is to give a more complete and thorough explanation of the wonderful MongoDB <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler/" target="_blank">profiler</a>. In previous presentations I have received wonderful feedback that I have moved pretty quickly through a lot of material. So I decided to change things a bit and just focus on the power that is the profiler.

I plan to cover some things that I have covered before, like using the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/aggregation/" target="_blank">Aggregation Framework</a> with the profiler to speed up the search for bad queries and helping to prioritize what queries to attack. But I will also present some completely new material around keeping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series" target="_blank">timeseries</a> data pulled from the profiler and how it can help identify and diagnose performance problems.

I hope to see everyone at 3:30 in Room 1. This is going to be good fun. I should have a stack of ObjectRocket <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/gallery/117-object-rocket-stickers" target="_blank">stickers</a> to give out as well, so hit me up!
