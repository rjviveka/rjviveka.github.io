I had a great time at the [MongoSF Conference][1] on Friday. There were a ton of great presentations, and lots and lots of excitement. A big thanks to [10gen][2] for inviting me to speak. I had a great time and I hope everyone learned a lot from our experiences so far with MongoDB. I especially liked Mike Dirolf&#8217;s discussion on Python and [pymongo][3]. There have been lots of changes as of late, and most of them fantastic!

Here are my slides from my presentation:
