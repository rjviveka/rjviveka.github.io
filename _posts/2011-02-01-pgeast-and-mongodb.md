When I first started playing with MongoDB I accidentially posted my posts in a category that got them put up on Planet PostgreSQL. I remember getting some pretty pissed off emails and [comments][1]. Beyond just my mistake such that the posting was on the incorrect blog, people seemed pretty pissed off about NoSQL in general. I remember thinking how closed minded that was. These are all different tools for different jobs, not a religion.

Well, it seems there is some hope! The [PostgreSQL Conference Series][2] folks have allocated some talks at [PGEast for MongoDB][3]. Nice job guys. Let&#8217;s hope there are lots of good discussions, there are lots of concepts I think that MongoDB can pick up from a more mature RDBMS like PostgreSQL and the reverse too!
