Sign up now for [MongoDB Seattle][1] happening on September 14 2012. I will be presenting on MongoDB Performance Tuning. I will be demonstrating some interesting ways of looking at MongoDB profiler data using the new Aggregation Framework as well as SSD disk usage, data locality, tools, read vs write tuning, and MongoDB 2.2 enhancements. Hope to see old friends and new!
