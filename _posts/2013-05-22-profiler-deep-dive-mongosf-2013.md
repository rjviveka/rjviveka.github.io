The presentation slides are [available](https://github.com/kgorman/presentations/tree/master/mongodb\_profiler\_deep_dive) on Github.

The MongoDB profiler is a powerful tool for analyzing and improving performance on a MongoDB system. I will show everything from the very basics to advanced usage. I will cover how to use the Aggregation Framework in conjunction with the profiler, profiler analytics, query tuning, and response time analysis.
