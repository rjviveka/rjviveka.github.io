I am very excited to say that it's time to say hello to [ObjectRocket](http://www.objectrocket.com)! A few weeks ago I made the move from a great place, to an even better opportunity. A couple of amazing guys and myself founded ObjectRocket Inc. It&#8217;s time to make ObjectRocket my full time job.

I have been at Shutterfly for almost two and a half years now. I am very proud of the teams [achievements](http://www.nosqldatabases.com/main/2011/1/6/q-a-with-kenny-gorman-data-architect-for-shutterfly-inc.html) in this timeframe. We brought a completely new technology into Shutterfly, and while we had some kinks, I am very proud of where we ended up. Shutterfly is one of the larger and perhaps more complex MongoDB production installations in existence. For some amount of time I will continue to help Shutterfly transition.

We created ObjectRocket with the idea that we can do something better than anyone else. Even the &#8216;big guys&#8217;. It&#8217;s time for me to focus on making customers happy with fantastic Engineering and Technology. Our initial concept has some legs, so I am going to pour my energies into making this idea a success. Frankly, I have never been so excited about something I have been doing in my life.

What is it we are doing? Well, we aren&#8217;t quite ready to announce that quite yet. But I can say that we plan to solve, what we believe are, serious problems in the MongoDB and NoSQL space. For now, it&#8217;s heads down on building something completely new and amazing. If you are curious, we will provide updates on <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/objectrocket>Twitter</a> so just follow us.
