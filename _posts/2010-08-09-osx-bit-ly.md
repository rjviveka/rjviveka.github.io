<img alt="" src="http://static.betaworks.com/corpsite/images/bitly_logotype.png" class="alignleft" width="150" />A couple months ago I didn&#8217;t even know what [bit.ly][1] was, I was using [tinyurl][2] for everything. Sheez, how web 1.0 of me. But after bit.ly [started using MongoDB][3] for it&#8217;s backend services, I started using it for url shortening. I just love the idea of web services, and bit.ly was crying out for a nice OSX implementation. I wanted full OSX compatibility instead of having to bring up a web browser each time I needed to shorten an url. [This Automator script turned that all around for me][4]. Now I use bit.ly for almost every url I ever copy/paste.
