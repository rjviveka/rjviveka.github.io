Great attendance and great interest in both MongoDB and <a href=http://www.objectrocket.com target=1>ObjectRocket</a>. I really enjoyed meeting some really interesting and smart folks, all looking to make the most of MongoDB and some with some particularly tricky problems. Lots of folks are interested in the new <a href=http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.2/>MongoDB 2.2 features</a>, and how they can leverage them to increase performance. I also got to spend some good time with old friends.. thanks!

Seattle is also a fantastic city, and the weather was just beautiful.
